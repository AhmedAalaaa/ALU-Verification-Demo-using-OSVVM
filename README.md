# ALU-Verification-Demo-using-OSVVM
## Description
This is a simple Verification environment demo for Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) using Open Source VHDL Verification Methodology (OSVVM)

## Overview
OSVVM is an advanced verification methodology that defines a VHDL verification framework, verification utility library, verification component library, and a scripting flow that simplifies your FPGA or ASIC verification project from start to finish. Using these libraries you can create a simple, readable, and powerful testbench that is suitable for either a simple FPGA block or a complex ASIC. [Ref](https://github.com/OSVVM)
